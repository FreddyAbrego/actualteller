# actualTeller

# Setup
-Create Teller.io developer Account
-Change .env. to .env and and fill in the blanks
-This assumes you already have you bank tokens. I do want to add it so you can do it all within this app
-You can find it by running the Teller-samples and seeing the key there after connecting your bank

# Some things worth noting
-You need actual budget accounts in order to link it
-This will pull only past the 30 transactions, thinking of last 60 depending on needs I can make this a env file config
-The first initial import does not have a starting balance, you will need to balance it out first.


# About
